## Set-up and data collection
Since the data we're working with is too large to put on GitHub, replicating our project requires some additional steps.
1. Create a folder called 'Data' in the root of the project folder
2. Visit [Datasets IMDB](https://datasets.imdbws.com/) and download all files. Add those files to the 'Data' folder.
3. Visit [Kaggle IMDB reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/imdb-spoiler-dataset?select=IMDB_reviews.json) and download all the files. Add thos to the 'Data' folder as well.
